HoneyPi
=======

This is a bash script to install/run Honeypot projects on a Raspberry Pi (Raspbian OS).

This has only been slightly tested and can be used as a guide for installing some of these projects on your own.

How to Run
======
You can either run git clone this repository or use wget:

cd ~

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/binkybear/HoneyPi/master/honeypotpi.sh --no-check-certificate
o
sudo chmod +x honeypotpi.sh

./honeypotpi.sh

OR -->

git clone https://github.com/binkybear/HoneyPi.git or git clone https://github.com/silent-mobius/HoneyPi.git

chmod +x install_HoneyPi.sh && ./install_HoneyPi.sh - install only things you don't have installed!
 
 To start the honeyPi :
      /etc/init.d/honeyPi start
